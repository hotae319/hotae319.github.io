### Intro   
  
I am a robotics engineer who is interested in **motion planning and machine learning for decision-making**. To be detailed, I am fascinated with making better autonomous behaivors and better decision-making for real-world complicated systems. Also, I am very interested in practical implementations such as autonomous vehicles, robot manipulators, and humanoids.

### Education
`Aug.2019 ~ May.2025` : Ph.D in Control, _UC Berkeley_

`Mar.2012 ~ Aug.2018` : B.S. in Mechanical Engineering , _Seoul National University_ (summa cum laude)

`Mar.2009 ~ Feb.2012` : _Seoul Science High School_ (for scientific-gifted students)

### Research Experience
`Aug.2019 ~ Present` : UC Berkeley Model Predictive Control Lab advised by Francesco Borrelli

`Mar.2017 ~ Jul.2018` : SNU Interactive and Networked Robotics Lab advised by Dongjun Lee

### Work Experience
`Jun.2025 ~ Present` : Zoox, Software Engineer in Autonomy Behavior team

`Jul.2018 ~ Apr.2019` : NAVER LABS, Robotics Team Intern
