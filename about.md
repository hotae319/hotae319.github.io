I am a robotics engineer who is interested in **control, optimization, motion planning and machine learning**. To be detailed, I am fascinated with some complicated systems with constraints and uncertain interactions in real-world environments, such as legged locomotion on the ground and multi-robot cooperation with humans. Also, I am interested in industrial and practical robots like wheeled mobile robots or quadrotors/drones or robot manipulators.

I was born in 1993, March 19 and graduated from _Seoul Science High School_, which is for scientific-gifted students.
I graduated 'summa cum laude' from _Seoul National University_ in August, 2018 and I was awared the honor graduation prize from alumni association. I am majored in mechanical & aerospace engineering. After graduation, I am preparing to apply to graduate schools in America. <U>I was already selected as a recipient of the Korean Government Ph.D. Scholarship for Study Overseas.</U> Moreover, I am working at Naverlabs robotics group to be equipped with practical skill sets.
