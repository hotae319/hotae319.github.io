### Intro   
  
I am a robotics engineer who is interested in **motion planning, optimal control and machine learning**. To be detailed, I am fascinated with some complicated systems with constraints and uncertain interactions in real-world environments. So, I want to improve the control performance under the uncertainties and improve the compuptational efforts for real-time tractability. Also, I am very interested in practical implementations such as autonomous vehicles, robot manipulators, and legged locomotion.

### Education
`Aug.2019 ~ May.2025` : Ph.D in Control, _UC Berkeley_

`Mar.2012 ~ Aug.2018` : B.S. in Mechanical Engineering , _Seoul National University_ (summa cum laude)

`Mar.2009 ~ Feb.2012` : _Seoul Science High School_ (for scientific-gifted students)

### Research Experience
`Aug.2019 ~ Present` : UC Berkeley Model Predictive Control Lab advised by Francesco Borrelli
