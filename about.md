### Intro   
  
I am a robotics engineer who is interested in **control, optimization, motion planning and machine learning**. To be detailed, I am fascinated with some complicated systems with constraints and uncertain interactions in real-world environments. So, I want to improve the control performance under the uncertainties and reduce the cost such as computating load. Also, I am interested in industrial and practical robots like autonomous driving cars, quadrotors/drones, robot manipulators, and legged locomotion.
