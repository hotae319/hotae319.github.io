I am a robotics engineer who is interested in control, optimization and machine learning. To be detailed, I am fascinated with some complicated systems such as legged robot's locomotion and multi-robots cooperation.

I was born in 1993, March 19 and graduated from Seoul Science High School, which is for scientific-gifted students.
I graduated from Seoul National University in August, 2018. I am majored in mechanical & aerospace engineering. After graduation, I am preparing to apply to graduate schools in America. Moreover, I am working at Naverlabs robotics group.
