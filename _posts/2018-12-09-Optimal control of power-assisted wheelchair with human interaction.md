# What I did

Let's say how and why I started my project in `NAVER LABS`.

I seriously wondered about the practicality of using theories in real robotic applications because my projects were mainly simulation based. 
To explore this curiosity, I worked at NAVER LABS Robotics group. I seized the opportunity to develop a human-interaction wheelchair controller. 
While I integrated all parts from sensors to communications, I became equipped with more practical skills. 
I also developed a robust force compensation control algorithm with pose estimation so the wheelchair could be driven freely on slopes. 
The unmeasured external force problem, a challenging obstacle for force control, was solved by my novel method of combining the reaction torque observer and extended Kalman filter. 
I realized how much the real-implementation performance depends on control and optimization algorithms. 
Additionally, I am developing constrained optimal algorithms for robust estimation to cover uncertain impacts from ground bumps. 

**Note** I cannot post all parts of the project because it belongs to the company's asset. So, I sum up my work briefly.
