title: Energy-Efficient Lane Changes Planning and Control for Connected Autonomous Vehicles on Urban Roads
summary: We proposed novel energy-efficient motion planning algorithm which consists of the lane selector, which selects a lane to reduce energy consumption
by minimizing the number of stops, and the energy-efficient trajectory planner, which generates a safe, smooth, and energyefficient trajectory toward the selected lane

# What I did

- ***Skill*** : Python, ROS2, CARLA 

- ***Keywords*** : Autonomous Vehicle, Connected Vehicles, Motion Planning, MPC tracking controller, Energy Saving

We have related project [website](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpcconnectedcars/home/arpa-e-nextcar-phase-ii?authuser=0). I am one of the main developer of intergrated systems on the vehicle/simulator. 

TBD..
