title: Energy-Efficient Lane Changes Planning and Control for Connected Autonomous Vehicles on Urban Roads
summary: We proposed novel energy-efficient motion planning algorithm which consists of the lane selector, which selects a lane to reduce energy consumption by minimizing the number of stops, and the energy-efficient trajectory planner, which generates a safe, smooth, and energyefficient trajectory toward the selected lane

We have a related project [website](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mpcconnectedcars/home/arpa-e-nextcar-phase-ii?authuser=0). 
The below figures are about our vehicles (IONIQ5, IONIQ Phev)

I am one of the main developer of intergrated systems on the vehicle/simulator. 
The below figures show our integrated system brifly and the basic architecture.

The main goal of this project is 1) to develope the connected autonomous vehicle system with V2X communications and Vehicle-In-the-Loop (VIL) integration 2) to develope energy-efficient driving algorithms with eco-cruise longitudinal trajectory and eco-smart lane change planning.
