title: Reinforcement Learning for multi-mobile manipulators cooperation with obstacle avoidance
summary: In this research, I apply DQN(Deep Q-network) to solving the cooperative carrying object problem. To optimize the learning method for navigation problem, this work uses curriculum learning and develops revised mini-batch sampling method which always includes a success state. Also, this work uses the method which reduces the action space through allocating one step for one agent.

From March 2018 to June 2018, I researched about stochastic control and reinforcement learning at SNU graduate lecture. While I was participating in this lecture, I focused on how to apply reinforcement learning to robotics research. Therefore, I decided the project topic about application of reinforcement learning to multi-robot cooperation problem. In particular, I tackled the carrying object problem.
