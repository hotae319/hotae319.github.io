# What I did

- ***Skill*** : Arduino, Basic System Integration(MCU, IMU, Bluetooth Communication), Matlab analysis and GUI Developemnt

- ***Keywords*** : IMU based record device, integration system between mcu and matlab with Serial/Bluetooth communications 

In a competition project for the Interdisciplinary Innovative Capstone Design lecture, my team developed the Fitness Automatic Record and Analysis Solution.
This lecture has a purpose to find the customer's needs and resolve the problem through the innovative method. I was in charge of embbeded programming of device and develop
I created MATLAB functions and Arduino code to analyze attitude data from IMU and send PID feedback to maintain a particular attitude, which earned me an excellence prize.
Our system saved their excercise records automatically and showed them intuitively. Moreover, it provided analyzed data about it. 

# Figure about our project

It is the imu-based device to recognize the movement of athlete and to communicate through bluetooths.

This is our whole system, which includes an automatically recognizing part, a movement sensing part and an analysis part.

This is the poster which explains how to use our solution system and what the strength is.

We got the first prize in the competiton and got the A+ grade in the lecture.  
After that, we took a picture in front of the poster and our booth.
