From March 2017 to December 2017, I researched about jumping robot's control at INROL(Interactive & Networed RObotics Lab). While I was working on this project, I focused on control for nonholonomic systems, under-actuated systems, and hybrid system.

With this topic, I published a conference paper for the 2018 IEEE Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR) and presented it as a spotlight talk at the conference. After this work, I continued further to study passive configuration decomposition and passivity based stabilization control for nonholonomic systems.
